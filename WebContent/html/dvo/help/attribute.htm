                    <p>To view property attributes by searching select one of the three search
                       methods located at the bottom of the page. They are Address Search, PIN
                       Search, and Name Search. Once you have performed a search you will get one
                       of three results.

                    <ol>
                        <li>The search will find a single property and the property attributes are
                            located on the right.
                        </li>

                        <br>
                        <li>The search will find multiple properties meeting your search criteria.
                            You will then need to select the property from the property attribute
                            area by clicking on the PIN. This will select the property, zoom to it, and
                            list the property attributes.

                    </ol>
                    <p>If you perform a search without getting any properties we advise the Zoom
                       and Select searching technique.

                                    property. Select the Zoom In tool and click and drag a window on the area
                                    that you would like to zoom in to. Continue to do so until you can identify
                                    the property you are interested in. Keep in mind that the property
                                    boundaries are scale dependent and will not turn on until you are below a
                                    scale of 1:15,000.
                    <p class="help">Once you find the property you are
                                    interested in, use the parcel select tool and single left click on the
                                    property. Check the property attribute area to see its information.
