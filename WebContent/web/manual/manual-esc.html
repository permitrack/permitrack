    <h4>
        Preparing to Create a New Project
    </h4>
    <p>
        Before creating a new project, you must set up the Project Types, Partners, and BMPs (Best Management Practices) that you will utilize within each project.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Define one or more Project Type(s)
    </h5>
    <p>
        Project types identify projects with a shared characteristic. For example, the type may be used to identify a residential site of less than one acre or a commercial site with more than five acres.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select Project Types within Settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "New" to create new Project Type.
        </li>
        <li>
            Name and define the Project Type.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the Save button.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>
        Define one or more Group(s)
    </h5>
    <p>
        Use groups to easily distinguish projects based on a specific feature, location, or other factor. For example, you can create a group for each inspector or for each area of the city. To set up a group to use with your projects:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select Groups within Settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "New" to create new Group.
        </li>
        <li>
            Name and define the Group.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the Save button.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Groups can reflect any category or characteristic you want to use for organizing groups. For example, set up a group for the East, West, North, and South sides of town.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Define Best Management Practices (BMPs) as necessary
    </h5>
    <p>
        BMPs identify a type of erosion control measure that you want to specify for one or more projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, set up a BMP to require a silt fence, temporary seeding, sediment basin, etc. The BMPs are selected during the project setup and are reflected on the inspection form for the project. A BMP can also be added to a specific inspection, as needed.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select BMPs within Settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "New" to create new BMP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select a category from the list, or enter a new category name. The BMP will be created under the category name that you enter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter a descriptive name and description for the BMP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the Save button.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the previous steps to add more BMPs, as needed.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>
        Define Templates (as necessary)
    </h5>
    <p>
        Inspection Templates let you group BMPs that are commonly applied together or at the same type of Project or Project site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Templates are not required, but they do help you quickly assign multiple BMPs to a project.<!-- To add BMPs and group them within a template:-->
        When you choose a Template for a given Project, all of the BMPs associated with the Template are assigned to the Project.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select Templates within Settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "New" to create new Template.
        </li>
        <li>
            Name the Template.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click Add BMP to add a BMP to the template.
        </li>
        <li>
            Indicate whether the BMP is required (see page for more information).
        </li>
        <li>
            Select a category and the name of the BMP from the drop-down lists.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the previous steps to add more BMPs to the template, as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the Save button.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>
        Define Partners as necessary
    </h5>
    <p>
        Partners are the organizations or companies that play a role in your project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set up at least one partner that you will assign to the project as a permittee, permit authority, or authorized inspector. (See
        <a href="#g.nmf14n">Terminology</a>
        for definitions of these roles.)
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the Partners menu item.
        </li>

    Inspections are recorded for each project by logging in to the program from a PDA or from a computer. For the inspection, you record weather data, specify the reason for the inspection, note compliance with BMPs required for the project, and attach a photo (if appropriate). You can also add new BMPs to an individual inspection record, as needed.

    Project Types
</h3>
<p>
    <a name="h.3fwokq0"></a>
    Project types provide a way to quickly identify projects by the type (residential versus commercial), size, use of SWMP (Storm Water Management Plan), etc. For example, you could create a type for residential sites of less than one acre or commercial sites with more than five acres. With project types assigned, you can easily group these projects by sorting the Type column on the Project List page ().
</p>
<p>
    Project types may also be used to identify groups of projects for more accurate accounting linked to project size or scope. Project types can be used to administer the number of projects associated with specific characteristics, such as the length of time the project data is stored on the system.
</p>
<p>
    The Project Type can be assigned to a project when it is created or edited.
</p>

<p>
    The Project Types page lists the project types created for your client site. From this page, you set up or edit the project types that can be selected for a new or existing project.

    The Project Types page opens when you click on the Project Types link on the Project List page ().

    <span>BMPs (Best Management Practice)</span>
</h2>
<p class="lead">
    <span>The Best Management Practices (BMPs) tab is used to define individual BMPs that can be assigned to projects, templates, or inspections. This tab is also used to create categories that are used to group the BMPs.</span>
</p><!--
<h4>
    <span>BMPs</span>
</h4>
-->
<p class="c8">
    <span>BMPs identify a type of erosion control measure that you want to specify for one or more projects. For example, set up a BMP to require a silt fence, temporary seeding, sediment basin, etc. The BMPs are selected during the project setup and are reflected on the inspection form for the project. A BMP can also be added to a specific inspection, as needed.</span>
</p>
<p class="c8">
    <span>BMPs are set up by the Client Administrator and made available to all client projects either directly or through a template. They can be:</span>
</p>
<ol>
    <li class="c9">
        <span>Added individually to a project at any time.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c9">
        <span>Set up and added to projects through a template when the project is created.</span>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    <span>Categories</span>
</h4>
<p class="c8">
    <span>Categories are used to identify the BMPs used for a specific purpose, for a specific size or type of project, or under specific circumstances. For example, assign the BMPs used for perimeter control to the Perimeter Control category.</span>
</p>
<p class="c8">
    <span>Categories are used to group the BMPs on the BMP list and to facilitate the process of assigning BMPs to a project, inspection, or template:</span>
</p>
<ol>
    <li class="c9">
        <span>On the BMP List page, the BMPs are grouped by category.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c9">
        <span>On the Create Project or New Template page, you select the category first, then select from a list of BMPs within the category.</span>

    <span>Templates</span>
</h2>
<p class="lead">
    <span>Templates let you group BMPs that you use frequently for a specific type of project or specific purpose. The template is used to associate a group of BMPs with a project without needing to assign each BMP individually to the project. Templates can be used for multiple projects. For example, create a template with the BMPs that typically apply to a small residential project. Each time you create a new project for small residential construction, select the template to automatically add the appropriate BMPs to the project.</span>
</p>
<p class="c8">
    <span>Using a template does not limit the BMPs that can be assigned to a project. After selecting a template for a new project, you can still specify additional BMPs for that project.</span>
</p>
<p class="c27 c14">
    <span>Note</span>
    <span>:A template is assigned to a project only when the project is created. To change the BMPs for an existing project, you must add or delete each BMP individually.</span>
