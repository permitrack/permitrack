<p>
    For convenience and to capture timely data, an inspector can log inspections at the project site using a PDA or handheld wireless device. Through a web connection from the PDA, the inspector logs in directly to the <strong>Permi</strong>Track<sub>ESC</sub> website. This login lets the inspector enter the inspection data, upload pictures taken with the handheld device, record notes, and save the inspection as a draft or final version. Back at the office, the inspector can review the inspection information or edit a draft inspection.
